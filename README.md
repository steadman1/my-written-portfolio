# Hi, I'm Spencer Steadman.

## Who Am I?
Hi, I'm Spencer Steadman‚Äîan independent, self-taught software engineer and student at Virginia Tech. As a student, and throughout my five years of programming, I have grown to love the process of learning and expressing my creativity through artistic mediums. Whether these mediums are code, graphic design, 3D design, etc., the projects I have been able to complete express my diverse skill sets in design and problem-solving. With these skills, I want to be part of a team of like-minded design-focused individuals. For more technical and experiential information, my LinkedIn has plenty more information about me: [Spencer Steadman‚ÄîAbout](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-steadman-642b38269/#About).  
Now for a more personal introduction! I'm Spencer Steadman‚Äîan athlete and self-proclaimed music connoisseur (my favorite artists being Steely Dan, Daft Punk, Radiohead. and The Beatles‚Äîcheck out [my Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/s_steadman) for more üåû). Growing up surrounded by music, I quickly gained my passion for creativity and analytical thinking as my brother and Dad would discuss each piece of every song. Through athletics, mainly running and swimming, I also developed a strong desire and ability to push myself in all fields. In my free time, I enjoy working on small design projects, iOS apps, occasionally some creative writing essays, and daydreaming about the beach.

## My Skills Shown Through Projects

### üé∂ My Interactive Portfolio Website üè°
‚û°Ô∏è [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com)  
(^ Heads up, the 3D model & textures are pretty large, so if it struggles to load on your device, try a more powerful device, find a better wifi connection, or refresh and give it some more time to load.)

#### ‚úçüèª The Portfolio Making Process
This was a fairly massive project for me as it combined programming with Typescript and Javascript, 3D design with Blender, and graphic design in Photoshop with a few posters I included in the apartment model. I want to stress that every aspect and detail of my portfolio was designed, programmed, and modeled entirely by me. This website ([source code here on my Github](https://github.com/steadman1/portfolio-website)) was my fourth big web project following my first basic [static portfolio](Static%20Portfolio/), a [virtual stock market](Virtual%20Stock%20Market/) attempt, and an earlier Three.js project with my [globe web app](Globe%20Web%20App/) which also heavily incorporated Blender. However, I decided the first three were great learning experiences but should probably stay offline. Following my first attempt at working with Three.js, as mentioned earlier, I decided to build my spencersteadman.com portfolio as a sort of conceptual extension of all three of my previous projects. With spencersteadman.com being a highly interactive display of my experience, hobbies, and goals, it serves to encapsulate my diverse skill sets into one place in a, in my opinion, impressive display of creativity. Another small detail of this website that I enjoyed was the design of the UI. As a self-taught beginner, at the time at least, to UI/UX design, I wanted to explore outside of the boring flat design that has flooded software following Apple's switch from skeuomorphism to the minimalist flat design with iOS 7. Although this was a great move by Apple leading to a revolutionary switch in front-end design, minimalism in software has become a framework for easy, low-skill, drag-and-drop design for companies to use to maximize profit. Side note: this is a very polarized version of my actual opinion on minimalist flat design‚ÄîI believe it's fantastic due to its simplicity for users and low barriers of entry for new designers like me. Back to my portfolio, though, working with 3D and 2D UI elements with a mix of claymorphism with my flat 3D textured objects and neumorphism with my Flat 3D HTML elements. This design challenge was a super interesting case study of mixing alternative UI styles and artistic mediums especially as companies like AirBnB and Apple explore innovative UI design as "Spatial Computing" has begun to emerge. 


### üåé My Globe Web App
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images here](https://github.com/steadman1/my-written-portfolio/tree/main/Globe%20Portfolio)

#### üë®üèº‚Äçüíª The Blender & Three.js Learning Process
As I mentioned in [*‚úçüèª The Portfolio Making Process*](#-the-portfolio-making-process), I had to learn and use Three.js for my current [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com) portfolio which proceeded my [My Globe Web App project](Globe%20Web%20App/). The idea for these two web app projects stemmed from my desire to explore outside of code, which I picked up in late 2019 through my participation in my school's International Baccalaureate program (which I also successfully graduated from and got my IB Diploma üëèüëè, thank you, thank you üëèüëè), and into more design fields. I had already been an active user of Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, so I decided to try pivoting to 3D modeling and 3D motion design with Blender in mid-2021. I started with a few YouTube tutorials where I created my version of the infamous ["Blender Donut."](Blender%20Showcase/Infamous%20Donut/) I continued my dive into 3D modeling pretty heavily with a variety of complex projects and 3D motion design & 3D animation projects ([plenty of showcase images here + .blend files!!](Blender%20Showcase/)). During this time, I got the idea to combine my newfound passion for 3D modeling with programming websites which I was also enjoying at the time. So, the initial idea for the spinning globe web app seemed like a logical line to follow. And then‚Äîboom‚Äîthe brainchild was formed. The development of the website was a blast especially since I got to learn Three.js and explore texturing in Blender which I discovered I'm admittedly pretty bad at. However, understanding and enjoying Three.js in combination with Blender was a driving force in completing the project which continued into the development of [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com). Following this timeline format, after finishing the globe web app project, I continued working in Blender with my favorite project being my [Ford Bronco]() model. Since completing my magnum opus Ford Bronco model, I haven't worked much with Blender mainly from my workload here at Virginia Tech. However, my desire to be creative is just as strong if not stronger, and I've been working on random small projects here and there.


### üçé My Swift Projects
‚û°Ô∏è [Ponder: Lucid Dream Journal](#-ponder-lucid-dream-journal)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Watch AI: AI on your wrist](#-watch-ai-ai-on-your-wrist)

‚û°Ô∏è [Spotify Buddy](#-spotify-buddy)  
(^ Spotify Buddy was actually written in Dart in combo with Flutter, but I felt that making an entire section for Flutter was unnecessary)

This collection of SwiftUI apps is extremely special to me and each represents an unbelievable amount of man-hours. The first few apps listed have been published on the App Store (except for Ponder, but it's extremely close to being finished). Each of these apps also represents a huge learning experience for me as each used a new technology or framework to complete.

#### üí≠ Ponder: Lucid Dream Journal
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()

This app has been by far my most challenging project incorporating a ton of technologies, design challenges, and planning. My original idea for this app came from my need for an organized dream journal that Apple's notes app didn't have‚Äîalso I love building apps, so I decided I had to make Ponder. Since then, I learned Figma, which was huge for me as I had wanted to learn it for the entirety of my app-making "career." Figma was a huge step forward for my ability to plan and prototype UI/UX elements, far far better than my previous pencil and notepad (which wasn't actually all that bad). For Ponder, I decided to make a [wireframe prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/1Ussz1ZcWqnENtqK7Cqn2b/ponder?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1) and a [fully fleshed-out prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/HFnIbqpI2WOGnquCQjvPt4/Ponder?type=design&node-id=113-7&mode=design) in Figma where small changes were made between each. From the designs in Figma, I started to build the app as I started my first at Virginia Tech. I still remember finishing my first day of Swift coding for Ponder in the Torgesen library bridge‚Äîit was a truly humbling experience trying to figure out SwiftUI's Path objects and the unreasonably annoying addArc() method. Since then, I have made fairly steady progress on Ponder, including the logo design, some motion design projects for Ponder, and graphic design posters. The development of Ponder has been, although very difficult, incredibly rewarding as I look back and see how far my designs, visions, and progression of Ponder have come. The app has firmly cemented my dream of becoming a design-focused full-stack developer. As I look forward, I also hope to see Ponder acquire the success that I believe it deserves!

#### ü§ñ Watch AI: AI on your wrist
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()

Watch AI was a big step in my SwiftUI development journey as it proved that code wasn't just a hobby for me, but could also be a source of legitimate income. This was also a great sign for my parents as the 12-hour programming grinds they occasionally grouched over weren't completely useless. This app was the brainchild of an idea I had in the middle of a senior-year history class a few weeks after OpenAI released ChatGPT of having an AI on my Apple Watch (Siri doesn't count). Following that idea, and since my senior year in high school was fairly easy following my contrastingly grueling junior year, I started working on the app and had it completed around 4 or 5ish months later. The app was super interesting to develop as I had to use lots of tricks to introduce features I felt were necessary for the app to have. For example, a live dictation feature is separate from Apple's built-in dictation feature to allow users to automatically start asking their prompt on wake. After publishing the app, I had to eventually include a subscription model for Watch AI as the API costs for OpenAI's Davinci model were far too high to come out of my pockets. This is where the "not just a hobby" realization comes in, and Watch AI ended up making me a decent chunk of passive income (and still does to this day). Watch AI not only introduced the idea of SaaS and Swift for Apple Watch to me but also introduced the idea of marketing. This is where I felt like I had the biggest breakthrough at the time, and I was able to develop some somewhat cringeworthy but decent (?) ads that have been archived on my Instagram. Overall, Watch AI was a huge stepping stone for me, however, since its release I've felt a strong need to update the app as changes to OpenAI's API and new models have broken pieces of the app.

#### üåê Liminal: AI web browser for Apple Watch 
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()

Liminal was a smaller step for me and was overshadowed quite heavily by Watch AI's success as Liminal was sort of only an extension of what I built with Watch AI. This section will be short because I believe that the development of Liminal was very similar to that of Watch AI. However, It helped bolster my ability to develop on Apple Watch and helped me further understand the basics of a cross-platform SwiftUI app. On top of this, Liminal does offer a legitimately useful extension of a mobile web browser on the Apple Watch with its inclusion of a chatbot to help answer questions on its limiting form factor. 

#### üìå Pin It! ‚Äî Location Counter
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()

Initially as a joke, Pin It was so incredibly enjoyable to work on as I was able to explore similar design styles and techniques as mentioned in [*‚úçüèª The Portfolio Making Process*](#-the-portfolio-making-process). However, I want to preface that Pin It is objectively not good in how it works. When it works it either requires the user to keep the app on when counting a location or is resource-intensive when counting visits in the background. Unfortunately, this wasn't something I had worried about at the time, but it has kind of come back to bite me in the ass. Either way, I believe Pin It is an interesting case study into my second attempt at alternative UI/UX design with its Duolingo-esque flat 3D styling. On top of this, it was an interesting look into the inner workings of Apple's Map API and developing apps that can help users interact and blend elements of the real world with technology. Also, this was my first app published on the App Store, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. The rush of seeing the "The status of Pin it! ‚Äî Location Counter has changed to approved" will never live itself down in my mind.

#### üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Swift Student Challenge 2023
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()  
‚û°Ô∏è [Source code here](https://github.com/steadman1/2023-swift-student-challenge)

My idea for my 2023 Swift Student Challenge application was an AR sandbox physics app that would allow users to interact with virtual 3D objects in their real environment. With this app, I aimed to appeal to the Apple judges with the AR as there were rumors that the Vision Pro (unnamed at the time) was going to come out soon. In the end, I unfortunately missed the submission deadline as I was adamant to make the app as perfect as I could which sounds so incredibly stupid as I read it back. Overall though, the app was pretty cool, but it probably wouldn't have won or gotten much recognition as the features I had implemented by the deadline weren't super groundbreaking. 

#### üëî MR Alpha: Meeting Recorder 
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here](/Swift%20Showcase/MR%20Alpha/)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Source code here](https://github.com/steadman1/mr-alpha)

During my high school junior year, notably following the COVID-19 quarantine year, missing classes was a common occurrence among my classmates as COVID paranoia raged. Even though I was lucky enough to stay healthy throughout the year, I saw plenty of my peers fall behind‚Äîa big change from the year prior, my entirely virtual sophomore year, where all of our online classes were recorded. On top of this, being sick didn't really matter‚Äîwe were still expected to open up our laptops and log in to class. So, as many of my classmates vanished from class as they were forced to quarantine, recording classes became a similarly common occurrence. However, simple recordings wasn't enough for me. So, I came up with the idea to develop an app that would instantly share transcribed, searchable recordings with groups of your choosing. MR Alpha, as I called it, was an incredibly exciting project that had a ton of practicality to it. From the UI to the codebase, at the time, this project was a huge development for me as, following my [Spotify Buddy](#-spotify-buddy) project, it was something I saw myself and others legitmately using consistantly. Unfortunately, I was unable to publish this app as the firebase API costs and Apple's $100 Apple Developer Account fee was far too steep for me. However, it stayed in use among my classmates which was so rewarding to see. Looking back, I'm still very proud of what I created with MR Alpha even though the UI/UX is somewhat questionable to me now.

#### üéº Spotify Buddy 
‚û°Ô∏è [Showcase images/videos here]()  
‚û°Ô∏è [Source code here](https://github.com/steadman1/Spotify-Buddy/tree/main)

As I mentioned in the preface of [üçé My Swift Projects](#-my-swift-projects), Spotify Buddy was written in Dart in combination with the Flutter SDK developed by Google. Although I absolutely loved working with Flutter in Spotify Buddy and a load of other test apps, I decided to make my switch to Swift as I found myself not using the suite of cross-platform features Flutter offered. Instead, I found myself targeting iOS and justifying my use of Flutter over Swift with "I could compile my apps onto Android and the Web" despite never doing so. After researching and exploring Swift5 and SwiftUI, I decided the switch from Flutter to Swift would be worth it since I already had a Mac and it would streamline my entire workflow. Plus, I wouldn't have to deal with XCode's constant throwing of random non-descript errors when working with Flutter. Back to Spotify Buddy, though, it was a pretty huge project for me at the time as I had previously only made small little test apps in Flutter. In contrast, this was a fully fledged, two week long project that had my focus working overtime. The process of writing the app was amazing, and, to this day, I loved working in Dart. With its similarity to Typescript, I believe it's a fantastic, familiar language with very beautiful syntax. Overall, Spotify Buddy was the push that got my love for mobile development rolling. For the app itself, I enjoyed the final product, and, to my surprise, I had many people hyping it up like crazy. Looking forward, I see a possible remake in the future üëÄ.

## üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A Look Into My Professional Life

### IT Internship at Emsco Inc.
‚û°Ô∏è [Find Emsco Inc. here!](https://emsco-inc.com/)

My 2023-2024 winter internship with Emsco was a fantastic learning experience that helped me develop a ton of technical and professional skills during my time with them. To preface, though, Emsco Inc. is a wire harness and PCB manufacturing company based in Ashland, VA, right outside of my hometown. Working as an IT intern for Emsco was an incredible exploration of a load of vital computer science concepts like data-structures, for example, and how we should approach implementing them in the workplace. My time with Emsco also required me to gain a strong understanding of Excel, PowerQuery, and Visual Basic. On top of this, prototyping ideas on paper and in Python became a constant before implementing them into our Excel Macros (mostly because VBA kinda sucks but thats beside the point). My time as Emsco was also a great learning experience in communication between my colleagues. Since my job was mostly discussing issues, bugs, and ideas and implementing them for my co-workers, I quickly picked up and understood the importance of strong communication skills and the idea of "failing small." This "failing small" philosophy was big around the office, and especially in IT, as modifications sometimes broke things that should never break. For example, we would often make small changes before consulting our colleagues to ensure our implementations were on the right track. This ensured a constantly efficient workflow where no time was wasted. Although this philosophy may seem somewhat of obvious or straight forward, it was absolutely vital to keep the company's operation flowing smoothly without sudden issues arising.

### 7 Years of Christian-Arabic Tutoring at Third Church RVA
‚û°Ô∏è [Find Third Church here!](https://www.thirdrva.org/)
‚û°Ô∏è [Find the tutoring program here!](https://www.thirdrva.org/refugee-tutoring)

As a seven-year volunteer tutor at Third Church RVA, I had the privilege of teaching Christian Arabic students. During this experience, I focused heavily on providing each tutoree, most of whom were ESL students, help with English as well as general academic support. With my diligent approach to tutoring, I enjoyed actively engaging with each tutoree encouraging each to develop a strong sense of curiosity and deep understanding of subject matters. This experience was so rewarding for me and helped me develop an incrediblely strong set of communication skills. On top of this, Christian-Arabic tutoring embeded the importance of diversity in the workplace within me. Where most just see a group of colleagues, I see a team of individuals who each bring nuanced perspectives and uniques strengths to the table, collectively capable of developing innovative solutions and fostering a strong collaborative spirit. Small side note: some of my tutorees in the tutoring program actually helped me translate part of my [Watch AI](#-watch-ai-ai-on-your-wrist) app into Arabic which was a ton of fun!
