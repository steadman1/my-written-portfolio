# My README.md Portfolio by Spencer Steadman.

## Who Am I?
Hi, I'm Spencer Steadman‚Äîan independent, self-taught software engineer and student at Virginia Tech. As a student, and throughout my five years of programming, I have grown to love the process of learning and expressing my creativity through artistic mediums. Whether these mediums are code, graphic design, 3D design, etc., the projects I have been able to complete express my diverse skill sets in design and problem-solving. With these skills, 
I'm excited for what the future holds and I'm keen to become a part of a progressive team, where my enthusiasm and skill sets can play a role in developing groundbreaking technology. My journey has been one of unwavering dedication toward excellence, and I look forward to learning from industry leaders, challenging my limits, and pushing the boundaries of tech. For more technical and experiential information, my LinkedIn has plenty more information about me: [Spencer Steadman‚ÄîAbout](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-steadman/#About).  
Who am I beyond the code and design work? At heart, I'm an athlete and self-proclaimed music connoisseur (my favorite artists being Steely Dan, Daft Punk, Radiohead. and The Beatles‚Äîcheck out [my Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/s_steadman) for more üåû). Growing up surrounded by music, I quickly gained my passion for creativity and analytical thinking as my family often delved into discussions over every lyric in each song on the radio played over my Dad's speaker setups. Athletics, running and swimming particularly, have instilled a strong resilience and determination that I carry with me in all areas of my life. In my free time, I enjoy working on small design projects, iOS apps, occasionally some creative writing essays, and daydreaming about the beach.

## My Skills Shown Through Projects

### üè°üé∂ My Interactive Portfolio Website
‚û°Ô∏è [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com)  
(^ Heads up, the 3D model & textures are pretty large, so if it struggles to load on your device, try a more powerful device, find a better wifi connection, or refresh and give it some more time to load.)

#### The Portfolio Making Process
This was a fairly massive project for me as it combined programming with Typescript and Javascript, 3D design with Blender, and graphic design in Photoshop with a few posters I included in the apartment model. I want to stress that every aspect and detail of my portfolio was designed, programmed, and modeled entirely by me. This website ([source code here on my Github](https://github.com/steadman1/portfolio-website)) was my fourth big web project following my first basic [static portfolio](Static%20Portfolio/), a [virtual stock market](Virtual%20Stock%20Market/) attempt, and an earlier Three.js project with my [globe web app](Globe%20Web%20App/) which also heavily incorporated Blender. However, I decided the first three were great learning experiences but should probably stay offline. Following my first attempt at working with Three.js, as mentioned earlier, I decided to build my spencersteadman.com portfolio as a sort of conceptual extension of all three of my previous projects. With spencersteadman.com being a highly interactive display of my experience, hobbies, and goals, it serves to encapsulate my diverse skill sets into one place in a, in my opinion, impressive display of creativity. Another small detail of this website that I enjoyed was the design of the UI. As a self-taught beginner, at the time at least, to UI/UX design, I wanted to explore outside of the boring flat design that has flooded software following Apple's switch from skeuomorphism to the minimalist flat design with iOS 7. Although this was a great move by Apple leading to a revolutionary switch in front-end design, minimalism in software has become a framework for easy, low-skill, drag-and-drop design for companies to use to maximize profit. Side note: this is a very polarized version of my actual opinion on minimalist flat design‚ÄîI believe it's fantastic due to its simplicity for users and low barriers of entry for new designers like me. Back to my portfolio, though, working with 3D and 2D UI elements with a mix of claymorphism with my flat 3D textured objects and neumorphism with my Flat 3D HTML elements. This design challenge was a super interesting case study of mixing alternative UI styles and artistic mediums especially as companies like AirBnB and Apple explore innovative UI design as "Spatial Computing" has begun to emerge. 


### üåé My Globe Web App

#### The Blender & Three.js Learning Process
As I mentioned in [*‚úçüèª The Portfolio Making Process*](#-the-portfolio-making-process), I had to learn and use Three.js for my current [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com) portfolio which proceeded my [My Globe Web App project](Globe%20Web%20App/). The idea for these two web app projects stemmed from my desire to explore outside of code, which I picked up in late 2019 through my participation in my school's International Baccalaureate program (which I also successfully graduated from and got my IB Diploma üëèüëè, thank you, thank you üëèüëè), and into more design fields. I had already been an active user of Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, so I decided to try pivoting to 3D modeling and 3D motion design with Blender in mid-2021. I started with a few YouTube tutorials where I created my version of the infamous ["Blender Donut."](Blender%20Showcase/Infamous%20Donut/) I continued my dive into 3D modeling pretty heavily with a variety of complex projects and 3D motion design & 3D animation projects ([plenty of showcase images here + .blend files!!](Blender%20Showcase/)). During this time, I got the idea to combine my newfound passion for 3D modeling with programming websites which I was also enjoying at the time. So, the initial idea for the spinning globe web app seemed like a logical line to follow. And then‚Äîboom‚Äîthe brainchild was formed. The development of the website was a blast especially since I got to learn Three.js and explore texturing in Blender which I discovered I'm admittedly pretty bad at. However, understanding and enjoying Three.js in combination with Blender was a driving force in completing the project which continued into the development of [spencersteadman.com](https://www.spencersteadman.com). Following this timeline format, after finishing the globe web app project, I continued working in Blender with my favorite project being my [Ford Bronco](#the-ford-bronco) model. Since completing my magnum opus Ford Bronco model, I haven't worked much with Blender mainly from my workload here at Virginia Tech. However, my desire to be creative is just as strong if not stronger, and I've been working on random small projects here and there.


### üçé My Swift Projects
‚û°Ô∏è [Ponder: Lucid Dream Journal](#-ponder-lucid-dream-journal)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Watch AI: AI on your wrist](#-watch-ai-ai-on-your-wrist)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Liminal: AI web browser for Apple Watch](#-liminal-ai-web-browser-for-apple-watch)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Pin It! ‚Äî Location Counter](#-pin-it--location-counter)

‚û°Ô∏è [Meeting Recorder](#-mr-alpha-meeting-recorder)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Spotify Buddy](#-spotify-buddy)  
(^ Spotify Buddy was actually written in Dart in combo with Flutter, but I felt that making an entire section for Flutter was unnecessary)

This collection of SwiftUI apps is extremely special to me and each represents an unbelievable amount of man-hours. The first few apps listed have been published on the App Store (except for Ponder, but it's extremely close to being finished). Each of these apps also represents a huge learning experience for me as each used a new technology or framework to complete.

#### üí≠ Ponder: Lucid Dream Journal
<p align="center">
   <img src="/Ponder Design Showcase/In App Screenshots/IMG_2799.PNG" width="100"/>
   <img src="/Ponder Design Showcase/In App Screenshots/IMG_2804.PNG" width="100"/>

   <img src="/Ponder Design Showcase/In App Screenshots/IMG_2796.PNG" width="100"/>
</p>

This app has been by far my most challenging project incorporating a ton of technologies, design challenges, and planning. My original idea for this app came from my need for an organized dream journal that Apple's notes app didn't have‚Äîalso I love building apps, so I decided I had to make Ponder. Since then, I learned Figma, which was huge for me as I had wanted to learn it for the entirety of my app-making "career." Figma was a huge step forward for my ability to plan and prototype UI/UX elements, far far better than my previous pencil and notepad (which wasn't actually all that bad). For Ponder, I decided to make a [wireframe prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/1Ussz1ZcWqnENtqK7Cqn2b/ponder?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1) and a [fully fleshed-out prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/HFnIbqpI2WOGnquCQjvPt4/Ponder?type=design&node-id=113-7&mode=design) in Figma where small changes were made between each. From the designs in Figma, I started to build the app as I started my first at Virginia Tech. In designing Ponder, I heavily incorporated the use of apps like Pinterest and Dribbble to hone in on the atmosphere I wanted to create within the app. It was a great learning experience with these tools and a similarly great dive into UI/UX inspiration and color theory. I still remember finishing my first day of Swift coding for Ponder in the Torgesen library bridge‚Äîit was a truly humbling experience trying to figure out SwiftUI's Path objects and the unreasonably annoying addArc() method. Since then, I have made fairly steady progress on Ponder, including the logo design, some motion design projects for Ponder, and graphic design posters. The development of Ponder has been, although very difficult, incredibly rewarding as I look back and see how far my designs, visions, and progression of Ponder have come. The app has firmly cemented my dream of becoming a design-focused full-stack developer. As I look forward, I also hope to see Ponder acquire the success that I believe it deserves!

#### ü§ñ Watch AI: AI on Your Wrist

Watch AI was a big step in my SwiftUI development journey as it proved that code wasn't just a hobby for me, but could also be a source of legitimate income. This was also a great sign for my parents as the 12-hour programming grinds they occasionally grouched over weren't completely useless. This app was the brainchild of an idea I had in the middle of a senior-year history class a few weeks after OpenAI released ChatGPT of having an AI on my Apple Watch (Siri doesn't count for obvious reasons). Following that idea, and since my senior year in high school was fairly easy following my contrastingly grueling junior year, I started working on the app and had it completed around 2 or 3ish months later. The app was super interesting to develop as I had to use lots of tricks to introduce features I felt were necessary for the app to have. For example, a live dictation feature is separate from Apple's built-in dictation feature to allow users to automatically start asking their prompt on wake. After publishing the app, I had to eventually include a subscription model for Watch AI as the API costs for OpenAI's Davinci model were far too high to come out of my pockets. This is where the "not just a hobby" realization comes in, and Watch AI ended up making me a decent chunk of passive income (and still does to this day). Watch AI not only introduced the idea of SaaS and Swift for Apple Watch to me but also introduced the idea of marketing. This is where I felt like I had the biggest breakthrough at the time, and I was able to develop some somewhat cringeworthy but decent (?) ads that have been archived on my Instagram. Overall, Watch AI was a huge stepping stone for me, however, since its release I've felt a strong need to update the app as changes to OpenAI's API and new models have broken pieces of the app.

#### üåê Liminal: AI Web Browser for Apple Watch

</p>

Liminal was a smaller step for me and was overshadowed quite heavily by Watch AI's success as Liminal was sort of only an extension of what I built with Watch AI. Although Liminal was very similar to the process and experience of developing Watch AI, it helped bolster my ability to develop on Apple Watch and helped me further understand the basics of a cross-platform SwiftUI app. On top of this, even though Liminal is very similar to Watch AI, Liminal does offer a legitimately useful extension of a mobile web browser on the Apple Watch with its inclusion of a chatbot to help answer questions on its limiting form factor. I've often found the image search feature to be extremely useful as Apple doesn't natively include any way to search for images on the Watch besides through Siri. Through this, Liminal was a great approach to extending the usefulness of the Apple Watch and helping it act as a standalone device.

#### üìå Pin It! ‚Äî Location Counter

Initially as a joke, Pin It was so incredibly enjoyable to work on as I was able to explore similar design styles and techniques as mentioned in [*‚úçüèª The Portfolio Making Process*](#-the-portfolio-making-process). However, I want to preface that Pin It is objectively not good in how it works. When it works it either requires the user to keep the app on when counting a location or is resource-intensive when counting visits in the background. Unfortunately, this wasn't something I had worried about at the time, but it has kind of come back to bite me in the ass. Either way, I believe Pin It is an interesting case study into my second attempt at alternative UI/UX design with its Duolingo-esque flat 3D styling. On top of this, it was an interesting look into the inner workings of Apple's Map API and developing apps that can help users interact and blend elements of the real world with technology. Also, this was my first app published on the App Store, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. The rush of seeing the "The status of Pin it! ‚Äî Location Counter has changed to Ready for Sale" will never live itself down in my mind. Double also, it was my first dive into passive social media "advertising" (so, without the paying social media companies part) which was super fun to explore allowing me to create some goofy designs in Photoshop. P.S. The designs I made are shown under the in-app screenshots.

#### üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Swift Student Challenge 2023

My idea for my 2023 Swift Student Challenge application was an AR sandbox physics app that would allow users to interact with virtual 3D objects in their real environment. When I finished the app back in early 2023, geometry was able to rest on a "ground" plane that your iPhone scans, however, since then the functionality has broken for whatever reason (üò∞). Still, the rigid-body physics works as well as the translation and raycasting of the geometry. So, if you want to, you can rotate, move, and scale each cube and add new cubes by tapping on the sides of each cube! With this app, I aimed to appeal to the Apple judges with the AR as there were rumors that the Vision Pro (unnamed at the time) was going to come out soon. In the end, I unfortunately missed the submission deadline as I was adamant to make the app as perfect as I could which sounds so incredibly stupid as I read it back. Overall though, the app was pretty cool, but it probably wouldn't have won or gotten much recognition as the features I had implemented by the deadline weren't super groundbreaking.

During my high school junior year, notably following the COVID-19 quarantine year, missing classes was a common occurrence among my classmates as COVID paranoia raged. Even though I was lucky enough to stay healthy throughout the year, I saw plenty of my peers fall behind‚Äîa big change from the year prior, my entirely virtual sophomore year, where all of our online classes were recorded. On top of this, being sick didn't really matter‚Äîwe were still expected to open up our laptops and log in to class. So, as many of my classmates vanished from class as they were forced to quarantine, recording classes became a similarly common occurrence. However, simple recordings weren't enough for me. So, I came up with the idea to develop an app that would instantly share transcribed, searchable recordings with groups of your choosing. MR Alpha, as I called it, was an incredibly exciting project that had a ton of practicality to it. From the UI to the codebase, at the time, this project was a huge development for me as, following my [Spotify Buddy](#-spotify-buddy) project, it was something I saw myself and others legitimately using consistently. Unfortunately, I was unable to publish this app as the Firebase API costs and Apple's $100 Apple Developer Account fee was far too steep for me. However, it stayed in use among my classmates which was so rewarding to see. Looking back, I'm still very proud of what I created with MR Alpha even though the UI/UX is somewhat questionable to me now.

#### üéº Spotify Buddy

As I mentioned in the preface of [üçé My Swift Projects](#-my-swift-projects), Spotify Buddy was written in Dart in combination with the Flutter SDK developed by Google. Although I absolutely loved working with Flutter in Spotify Buddy and a load of other test apps, I decided to make my switch to Swift as I found myself not using the suite of cross-platform features Flutter offered. Instead, I found myself targeting iOS and justifying my use of Flutter over Swift with "I could compile my apps onto Android and the Web" despite never doing so. After researching and exploring Swift 5 and SwiftUI, I decided the switch from Flutter to Swift would be worth it since I already had a Mac and it would streamline my entire workflow. Plus, I wouldn't have to deal with XCode's constant throwing of random non-descript errors when working with Flutter. Back to Spotify Buddy, though, it was a pretty huge project for me at the time as I had previously only made small test apps in Flutter. In contrast, this was a fully-fledged, two-week-long project that had my focus working overtime. The process of writing the app was amazing, and, to this day, I love working in Dart. With its similarity to Typescript, I believe it's a fantastic, familiar language with very beautiful syntax. Overall, Spotify Buddy was the push that got my love for mobile development rolling. For the app itself, I enjoyed the final product, and, to my surprise, I had many people hyping it up like crazy. Looking forward, I see a possible remake in the future üëÄ.

‚û°Ô∏è [The Ford Bronco Model](#the-ford-bronco)  

This collection of design projects of mine is mostly a creative outlet for me rather than a source of monetization. However, I believe that they hold up extremely well despite being a simple hobby of mine. Each of these projects was created using a combination of software, for example, most animations were modeled and rendered in Blender and compiled into a video using Adobe Premiere Pro. From working on these projects in my free time, I have become proficient in the Adobe suite which has been so fun as I can essentially make whatever I want, whenever I want! Side note: videos are well supported in Github's Readme files, so all of the videos have links where you can view them on my Instagram page.

#### The Ponder Logo
<p align="center">

   <img src="/Ponder Design Showcase/ponder_photoshop_full.png" height="180"/>
</p>

The development of Ponder has been so technically rewarding especially because of its pretty massive scope. With the creation of the logo you see above, I was able to extend Ponder from just an outwardly-facing software project to being an all-encompassing design project. Overall, I'm still in love with the logo just as much as the moment I finished it. Tools I used to create it were pencil and paper, Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop!

#### A Ponder Motion Design Study

</p>

This was another crazy extension of Ponder's scope as it involved learning several new pieces of software and design techniques. Starting with the most obvious, this project used Adobe After Effects for the motion design which was fairly easy to learn coming from Premiere Pro and Photoshop. However, it was super interesting to use Photoshop as an intermediate in this project as it is usually a tool I use to finalize/entirely create projects! On top of learning After Effects, I also learned Garage Band and the basics of sound design to add an extra layer of depth to the already solid animation! Tools I used to create it were once again a pencil and paper, Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Garage Band!

#### The Ponder Poster Collection

</p>

This design project was super refreshing as it helped me stay creative and productive during a break I took from programming the [Ponder app](#-ponder-lucid-dream-journal). Each of the posters, designed in Photoshop, came out looking fantastic‚Äîeach with a bit of humor as they attempt to parody popular 70's - 80's ads. My favorite was by far the "With Ponder, any dream can take flight." poster. From its colors to its typography, and with its graphics, the poster takes on the exact vintage feel that I aimed to achieve. These posters also double as ads too, so the whole creation process was a win-win‚Äîa fun creative outlet combined with a source of publicity for Ponder when its full release drops. Tools I used to create it were, of course, a pencil and paper, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop!

</p>

This animation marked the beginning of my Blender "animation journey" as it was my first animation with a true narrative. On top of this, after posting it to my Instagram page, it gained a decent amount of traction which gave me a great amount of motivation to continue. This project was an incredible venture into storyboarding in addition to the obvious 3D modeling and animation basics. I still really enjoy this animation as it leaves the viewer with a lot to question. Also, I love the stylized look I decided to use for the project!

#### A Katana and Knights Helmet
<p align="center">

</p>

This animation is probably my favorite in terms of the motion design‚Äîit's just so satisfying to watch. The renders and animations of the katana and knight's helmet were a blast to make mostly because of all the interesting materials and reflections the models made. On top of the fact that I was able to add some pretty nice sound design into it too, I still believe it to be a great display 3D modeling, motion design and sound design skills despite its age.

#### A DeLorean

</p>

I still remember working on this animation on the plane to San Francisco during my junior year of high school. I'm so incredibly proud of the render and it, similar to the [Katana and Knights Helmet render](#a-katana-and-knights-helmet), has stood the test of time very well. This project was my first attempt at making a photorealistic car, and my success with the model was a driving force (ü•¥) in my completion of my [Ford Bronco model](#the-ford-bronco).

#### Spoon Catapult
<p align="center">

</p>

"The idea for this animation popped into my head, and I‚Äôm so glad I made it. This animation was a TON of fun to do and I loved literally every part of it. The sound design was especially fun because I got to revisit all the old Wii Sports sound effects ü•≤. This week, working in Blender and on 3D projects has been the most fun it ever has been, and I can‚Äôt wait to work on more stuff soon!! Hope you guys are enjoying the loops too! üôèüí™" -Spencer from 92 weeks ago (from my Instagram caption). I still love this animation, especially with the inclusion of the fitting background music from YELLOW MAGIC ORCHESTRA which my Dad and I used to listen to.

#### Saturn‚Äôs Ring Highway
<p align="center">

<p align="center">
   ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg0218nghQQ/?img_index=1">View the render on my Instagram!!</a>
</p>

This render, now my MacBook wallpaper, was a surrealist piece inspired by the works of [@linearcollages](https://www.instagram.com/linearcollages/?img_index=1) on Instagram. It was a fantastic dive into surrealism and a personal case study of how I would approach works of inspiration. Side note: this render includes the debut of my [Ford Bronco model](#the-ford-bronco) in the back! It adds a fun small detail that is barely noticeable, but I still love it. 

#### The French Touch
<p align="center">

   ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca8nGnIAZXg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Watch the full "French Touch" animation on my Instagram!!</a>
</p>

The French Touch animation (heavily inspired by Daft Punk) is the story of Daft Punk's song "Digital Love" shown through the visual narrative I created with two short scenes. Although the animation is packed with meaning, the narrative is primarily about the unresolved dreams of the Daft Punk characters and how love has escaped them. I portrayed this loss through the desert scene with the lonely helmet as the previous scene fades to black as if to say the memory shown is stored only within the helmet. Then, as the camera zooms out, it's clear the dreams of the character derived from those lost memories have now been deserted and left to wither away whether intentional or not. The animation also includes a switch in its sound as the camera zooms out into the desert scene to give the effect of the sound being played through a radio. As I rewatch the video, this detail is somewhat easy to miss as phone speakers have trouble reproducing the right sound for whatever reason, unfortunately. This animation as a whole has held up super well both in terms of the creative vision as well as its visual style.

#### Backyard In a Blue Void

</p>

This project was the product of my attempt to see if I could fit a Steely Dan song into one of my animations which I believe I succeeded in! The inspiration behind this animation was a combination of nostalgia bait and liminal spaces which I implemented shown through the blue void in the back. The uneasy feeling and digitally nostalgic display of the scene with its pixelated look helped build a strong atmosphere for the reverbed, similarly nostalgic, Kid Charlemagne by Steely Dan in the background.

#### The Ford Bronco
<p align="center">

</p>

Still incomplete, this project has been an incredibly time-consuming conceptual extension of my [DeLorean](#a-delorean). Currently, the model is mostly untextured, however, the geometry is done. The detail, planning, and research that has gone into the model have been borderline overwhelming. It's pretty unfortunate to not have beautiful renders published here, but if you want to take a look at the model, please [contact me](#contact-information), and I'll send the .blend file and some showcase videos over (they're too large to upload to GitHub)!

   Candide by Voltaire‚Äîmy inspiration for this piece!
</p>

This piece, my best according to my Mom and Grandpa, inspired by the absurdist style of Voltaire‚Äôs Candide, is about a brainwashed capitalist society living around a Dutch University that has become a victim of an extreme wealth gap and its solution is to print money to temporarily inflate the lower class‚Äôs perceived wealth (The US in 2020 to now). Plus, I included a small critique of the modern-day ‚Äúgrind set‚Äù mentality that has gone way too far. I absolutely loved writing this picaresque-structured piece with its pretentious and whimsy style.

   The three objects in the essay!
</p>

This piece, inspired by the beautiful essays of Virginia Woolf, tells the story of my consciousness as I fall asleep at my desk. As my mind remembers a few certain memories associated with objects on my desk in front of me, my consciousness flies through the city built from my memories and experiences with the city's lights reacting with each memory's importance. The end of the piece is by far my favorite of any piece I have ever written. This piece is conceptually one of my favorites besides [The Most Wonderful of Metaphysico-socio-arch-economical Systems](#the-most-wonderful-of-metaphysico-socio-arch-economical-systems) piece. Overall, this piece acts an an incredibly powerful lens into how my mind works, and, because of that, I cherish it quite a lot.

   <img src="/Creative Writing/Eccentric_Memories_Mini_Piece.jpeg" width="450"/>
</p>

With inspiration from a mini piece I worked on in combo with a little doodle of a dock, this piece is the brainchild of my dream to live on a small sailboat. With the extensive beach and water motifs, this piece is a similarly powerful lens of [A Bird‚Äôs Eye View](#a-birds-eye-view) into my psyche as I grew up constantly surrounded by pools, beaches, and the sprinklers I used to run through in my backyard. This essay also acted as a case study of how well I could blend scenes together. In the end, I'm really proud of this essay's imagery, narrative, and transitions, so I guess I succeeded in my goal!

## üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A Look Into My Professional Life

### IT Internship at Emsco Inc.
‚û°Ô∏è [Find Emsco Inc. here!](https://emsco-inc.com/)

My 2023-2024 winter internship with Emsco was a fantastic learning experience that helped me develop many technical and professional skills during my time with them. To preface, though, Emsco Inc. is a wire harness and PCB manufacturing company based in Ashland, VA, right outside of my hometown. Working as an IT intern for Emsco was an incredible exploration of a load of vital computer science concepts like data structures, for example, and how we should approach implementing them in the workplace. My time with Emsco also required me to gain a strong understanding of Excel, PowerQuery, and Visual Basic. On top of this, prototyping ideas on paper and in Python became a constant before implementing them into our Excel Macros (mostly because VBA kinda sucks but that's beside the point). My time at Emsco was also a great learning experience in communication between my colleagues. Since my job was mostly discussing issues, bugs, and ideas and implementing them for my co-workers, I quickly picked up a deep understanding of teamwork dynamics and invaluable teamwork dynamics. I understood the importance of strong communication skills and the idea of "failing small." This "failing small" philosophy was big around the office, and especially in IT, as modifications sometimes broke things that should never break. For example, we would often make small changes before consulting our colleagues to ensure our implementations were on the right track. This ensured a constantly efficient workflow where no time was wasted. Although this philosophy may seem somewhat obvious or straightforward, it was vital to keep the company's operation flowing smoothly without sudden issues arising.

### 7 Years of Immigrant and Refugee Tutoring at Third Church RVA
‚û°Ô∏è [Find Third Church here!](https://www.thirdrva.org/)  
‚û°Ô∏è [Find the tutoring program here!](https://www.thirdrva.org/refugee-tutoring)

As a seven-year volunteer tutor at Third Church RVA, I had the privilege of teaching Christian Arabic students. During this experience, I focused heavily on providing each tutee, most of whom were ESL students, help with English as well as general academic support. With my diligent approach to tutoring, I enjoyed actively engaging with each tutee encouraging each to develop a strong sense of curiosity and deep understanding of subject matters. This experience was so rewarding for me and helped me develop a powerful set of communication skills. On top of this, Christian-Arabic tutoring embedded the importance of diversity in the workplace within me. Where most just see a group of colleagues, I see a team of individuals who each bring nuanced perspectives and unique strengths to the table, collectively capable of developing innovative solutions and fostering a strong collaborative spirit. Small side note: some of my tutees in the tutoring program actually helped me translate part of my [Watch AI](#-watch-ai-ai-on-your-wrist) app into Arabic which was a ton of fun!

### A Position With Your Company üëÄ (?)

As I look forward, I'm so incredibly excited to see what the future holds for me. Whether it be in software or design, I'm eager to join a team of like-minded individuals where we can build both technically and socially while developing groundbreaking solutions. As I stand out from my peers with my experience and skill sets, I bring a unique blend of creativity, technical prowess, passion for innovation, and collaborative expertise. So far, my journey has been marked by the unrelenting pursuit of excellence in all fields I have explored, and it would be an extraordinary honor to share my abilities with a diverse team at the forefront of technology. Joining your company would represent an opportunity to be at the cutting edge of the market, where I can apply my skills, learn from the best, and together, push the boundaries of what's possible.
